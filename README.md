# stata_code
This repository contains all the Stata code that I wrote during my summer internship at the central bank of Spain (Banco de Espana) between July to September 2020. I worked with [Dr. Federico Tagliati](https://sites.google.com/site/federicotagliati/) during my time at the bank. 

Durind the internship I primarily helped with data cleaning of a large(much larger than memory), panel data set. I also performed a bit of literature review surrounding Spanish labor regulations with regards to temporary employees.
